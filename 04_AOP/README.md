# Spring AOP Core Concepts
**Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** complements Object-oriented Programming
(OOP) by providing another way of thinking about program structure.

The key unit of modularity in OOP is class, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity
is the aspect. Aspects enable the modularization of concerns(such as logging, transaction
management, security, etc.) that cut across multiple types and objects.
(Such concerns often termed "cross-cutting" concerns in AOP literature).

The powerful feature of the Spring Framework that allows developers to add
cross-cutting concerns(such as logging, transaction management, security, etc.)
to their application **without modifying the actual business logic.**

## Spring AOP Use Cases
### 1. Logging
AOP can be used to log method entry, exit and exceptions across various layers of
an application without cluttering the business logic with logging code.

### 2. Transaction Management
AOP can manage transactions declaratively, ensuring that business methods are
executed within a transactional context without manually managing transaction
boundaries.

### 3. Security
AOP can be used to enforce security constrains by checking permissions before
executing a method.

### 4. Performance Monitoring
AOP can measure the performance of methods by recording execution time,helping
identify bottlenecks in the application.

### 5. Exception Handling
AOP can centralize exception handling by applying consistent error handling
policies across multiple methods.

### 6. Caching
AOP can be used to implement caching, allowing frequently accessed data to be
stored and retrieved quickly.

### 7. Audit Logging
AOP can automate the recording of audit logs for critical actions in the application,
ensuring compliance and traceability.
